# SQL-Agent Coding Routine

This document outlines the standard coding practices and routines to be followed during development of the SQL-Agent project.

## Daily Development Cycle

1. **Session Start**
   - Review the previous session's summary document (`SESSION_SUMMARY_YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
   - Review the current tasks list (`NEXT_SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
   - Verify environment setup (virtual environment, dependencies)

2. **During Session**
   - Follow coding standards in CLAUDE.md
   - Use git branches for significant features
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Write tests for new functionality

3. **Session End**
   - Summarize the day's work in a new `SESSION_SUMMARY_YYYY-MM-DD.md` file
   - Create/update `NEXT_SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md` for future tasks
   - Commit all changes with descriptive commit messages
   - Keep work in progress documentation in the appropriate summary files

## Documentation Standards

### Session Summary Files
Session summary files should follow this format:
```
# Session Summary: [Brief Title] (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Overview

### Branching Strategy
- `main` - Stable, production-ready code
- `feature/[feature-name]` - For new features
- `bugfix/[issue-description]` - For bug fixes

## Testing Standards
- Unit tests should be written for all new functionality
- Tests should be run before committing changes
- Tests should cover edge cases and error conditions

## Code Review Process
- All code should be reviewed before merging
- Reviewers should check for:
  - Code quality and style
  - Test coverage
  - Documentation
  - Security implications

## Daily Documentation Update Process
1. Create new dated session files at the end of each coding session:
   ```bash
   # Get current date
   TODAY=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
   
   # Create session summary from template
   cp SESSION_SUMMARY.md SESSION_SUMMARY_$TODAY.md
   
   # Create next session file with tomorrow's date
   TOMORROW=$(date -d "tomorrow" +"%Y-%m-%d")
   cp NEXT_SESSION.md NEXT_SESSION_$TOMORROW.md
   ```

2. Update the generic files to point to the latest dated files:
   ```bash
   ln -sf SESSION_SUMMARY_$TODAY.md SESSION_SUMMARY.md
   ln -sf NEXT_SESSION_$TOMORROW.md NEXT_SESSION.md
   ```

# Session Summary: Remote Model Integration and Default Model Changes

## Overview
In this session, we enhanced the SQL agent by adding support for remote models (particularly Haiku 3.5) and changing the default local model to phi:latest. We implemented a secure API key management system and created user-friendly commands for managing remote models. These improvements help address the previous challenges with local model performance and provide faster, more reliable alternatives through remote API integration.

## Key Achievements

1. **Remote Model Integration**
   - Created a remote model provider framework with API integration
   - Implemented support for Anthropic's Haiku 3.5 model
   - Added secure API key management through secrets file
   - Updated .gitignore to prevent accidental API key commits
   - Added UI commands for managing remote models

2. **Default Model Changes**
   - Changed default local model to phi:latest (most reliable in testing)
   - Updated model manager to prioritize phi:latest in fallback sequence
   - Implemented automatic fallback to remote models when local models fail
   - Added hybrid mode support (can switch between local and remote models)

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Created secure secrets management system with ~/.sql_agent_secrets file
   - Updated .gitignore to prevent API keys from being committed to git
   - Added sample_secrets template file for user convenience
   - Implemented environment variable override for API keys

4. **UI and Command Improvements**
   - Added new commands for remote model management:
     - `/list_remote_models` - List available remote models
     - `/use_remote [model_id]` - Use a remote model
     - `/use_local` - Switch back to local model
     - `/set_api_key [provider] [api_key]` - Set API key for a remote provider
   - Enhanced status display to show remote model information
   - Updated help and documentation with new commands

## Technical Implementation Details

1. **Remote Model Provider Architecture**
   - Created a `RemoteModelConfig` dataclass for flexible provider configuration
   - Implemented a base `RemoteModelProvider` class with common functionality
   - Created specific provider implementations (e.g., `AnthropicProvider`)
   - Added factory method for creating providers based on configuration
   - Implemented secure API key retrieval from secrets file or environment

2. **Secrets Management System**
   - Created `SecretsManager` class for secure API key storage
   - Implemented priority-based key retrieval (env vars > secrets file)
   - Added secure file permissions (chmod 600) for secrets file
   - Created sample template for secrets file setup

3. **Integration with Existing Architecture**
   - Updated `ModelManager` to handle both local and remote models
   - Modified `Text2SQLAgent` to support remote model inference
   - Updated UI commands in main.py to support remote model management
   - Enhanced status reporting to include remote model information

## Code Modifications

1. **Created New Modules**:
   - `src/sql_agent/utils/models/remote.py` - Remote model provider framework
   - `src/sql_agent/utils/models/secrets.py` - Secrets management system
   - `sample_secrets` - Template for API key configuration

2. **Modified Existing Files**:
   - Updated model manager to support remote models and phi:latest as default
   - Enhanced agent initialization and request handling for remote models
   - Updated main.py with new commands for remote model management
   - Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation

## Learning Insights

1. **Hybrid Model Approach**:
   - Local models provide privacy but suffer from performance limitations
   - Remote models offer superior performance but require API keys and connectivity
   - A hybrid approach gives users flexibility based on their needs
   - Automatic fallback mechanisms improve reliability

2. **API Key Security**:
   - Secure storage of API keys is critical for production applications
   - Multiple layers of security (file permissions, .gitignore) are necessary
   - Environment variables provide flexibility for deployment scenarios
   - Clear documentation helps users set up securely

3. **Architecture Flexibility**:
   - The provider pattern allows easy addition of new model providers
   - Separating configuration from implementation improves maintainability
   - Factory methods simplify provider creation based on configuration
   - Centralized secrets management improves security

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remote model inference implementation (request method)
2. Add support for additional remote model providers
3. Create a comprehensive testing suite for remote models
4. Enhance UI with visual indicators for remote model usage
5. Implement progress indicators for long-running queries
6. Add caching for repeated queries to improve performance

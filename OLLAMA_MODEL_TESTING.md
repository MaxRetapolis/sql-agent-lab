# Ollama Model Testing Results

## Summary
We've tested all available Ollama models for compatibility with our SQL Agent application. Unfortunately, all models exhibited various issues.

## Test Results

| Model | Size | Issue | Details |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| qwen2.5-coder:0.5b | 531 MB | ❌ Tensor error | `tensor 'output.weight' not found` |
| qwen2.5-coder:1.5b | 986 MB | ❌ Tensor error | `tensor 'output.weight' not found` |
| llama3.2:1b | 1.3 GB | ❌ Tensor error | `tensor 'output.weight' not found` |
| deepseek-r1:1.5b | 1.1 GB | ⚠️ Slow response | Exceeds 60s timeout but starts generating with longer timeouts |
| phi:latest | 1.6 GB | ⚠️ Slow response | Exceeds 60s timeout but starts generating with longer timeouts |
| gemma2:latest | 5.4 GB | ❌ Architecture error | `unknown model architecture: 'gemma2'` |

## Testing with Extended Timeouts
After doubling all timeouts in the codebase:

1. Local Ollama service runs at 85% CPU usage
2. Models like phi and deepseek begin generating output after extended waiting
3. Direct CLI access shows the same behavior - slow responses but eventual output
4. High CPU usage suggests the compute resources are the bottleneck
5. Possible memory pressure causing swapping/high latency

## Analysis

The consistent "tensor 'output.weight' not found" error suggests an incompatibility between the Ollama version/configuration and the model formats. This error appears consistently across multiple model architectures.

The timeouts with larger models indicate that the local machine likely lacks sufficient resources to run inference with these models efficiently.

## Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced model fallback mechanism:**
   - Added blacklisting for models known to have tensor issues
   - Reordered fallback preferences to prioritize potentially working models
   - Improved error detection for different model failure types

2. **Better testing tools:**
   - Created dedicated test scripts to evaluate model compatibility
   - Added model-specific error detection and reporting
   - Made test results visible in the application UI

3. **Updated documentation:**
   - Added detailed test results to status files
   - Updated next session planning to account for model issues
   - Documented findings for future development

## Next Steps

1. **Remote Ollama Setup:**
   - Set up a dedicated remote Ollama server with better resources
   - Test with different Ollama versions to see if tensor issues persist
   - Consider Docker-based Ollama deployment for better isolation

2. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Investigate alternative model formats beyond those currently tested
   - Test with older Ollama versions to check for regression issues
   - Consider alternative LLM backends (e.g., local LM Studio)

3. **Error Handling Improvements:**
   - Enhance the application's ability to detect and work around model issues
   - Add more granular error reporting for different types of model failures
   - Create an automated model compatibility checker for initial setup

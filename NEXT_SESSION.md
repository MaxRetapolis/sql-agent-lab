# Tasks for Next Session

## Implemented Features to Review
1. **Default Local Model and Remote Integration**
   - ✅ Changed phi:latest as the default local model
   - ✅ Implemented remote model support with Haiku 3.5
   - ✅ Added secure API key management
   - ✅ Created UI commands for managing remote models
   - Next steps:
     - Complete the remote model inference implementation (request method)
     - Add support for other remote model providers
     - Create a comprehensive testing suite for remote models

2. **UI Improvements for Remote Models**
   - ✅ Added commands for setting API keys
   - ✅ Added commands for switching between local and remote models
   - Next steps:
     - Add visual indicators for remote model usage
     - Add a settings panel for managing API keys
     - Implement progress indicators for long-running queries

## Critical Issues to Address

1. **Model Compatibility Issues**
   - Local models still have tensor initialization errors and slow performance
   - Need better error handling for tensor initialization failures
   - Implement automatic fallback to remote models on local failures
   - Consider pre-downloading phi:latest during installation

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Measure query response times for remote vs local models
   - Implement caching for repeated queries
   - Optimize database schema parsing for large databases

3. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Create test suite for remote model API integration
   - Document all new remote model features
   - Update user guide with API key setup instructions

## Enhancement Ideas

1. **Advanced Remote Model Features**
   - Add temperature and other model parameter controls
   - Implement streaming responses for better UX
   - Add system message customization
   - Implement model response caching

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add encryption for stored API keys
   - Implement token usage tracking and limits
   - Add user authentication for multi-user setups

## Documentation Needs

1. **Remote Model Guide**
   - Document API key acquisition process
   - Provide examples of model performance differences
   - Add troubleshooting section for API connectivity issues

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Document the remote model provider architecture
   - Explain how to add new model providers
   - Provide examples for customizing model parameters

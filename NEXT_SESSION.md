# Tasks for Next Session

## Critical Issues to Address

1. **Model Compatibility Issues**
   - ✅ Doubled all timeout values throughout the codebase
   - ✅ Tested phi:latest and deepseek-r1:1.5b models - confirmed working but slow
   - ✅ Created configurable timeout system with env var overrides
   - Other models (qwen2.5-coder:0.5b, qwen2.5-coder:1.5b, llama3.2:1b) still have tensor initialization errors
   - gemma2:latest still has architecture compatibility issues
   - Recommendations:
     - Set phi:latest as the default model (most reliable in testing)
     - Consider switching to remote mode with more powerful hardware
     - For local use, recommend OLLAMA_TIMEOUT_INFERENCE_FIRST_TOKEN=180 (3 min)
     - Document the slow performance for users (2-3 minute response times)
     - Focus optimization efforts on model caching and query pre-processing

2. **Package Dependencies**
   - Establish a proper virtual environment for the application
   - Install required packages:
     ```
     python3 -m pip install --user python-dotenv gradio sqlalchemy agno
     ```
   - Consider using a requirements.txt file for better dependency management

3. **Application Testing**
   - ✅ Verified local models work but with high latency (CPU bottleneck)
   - Test full application with remote Ollama
   - Verify mode switching functionality in the UI
   - Test session recovery mechanisms
   - Create benchmarks to measure query response times with different models

## Enhancement Ideas

1. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Add more descriptive error messages for Ollama connectivity issues
   - Create diagnostic tool to verify model compatibility
   - Add retry mechanism for transient errors

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile SQL query execution times
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed database schemas
   - Add database connection pooling

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Add real-time model status indicator
   - Provide visual feedback during model switching
   - Display database schema visualization

## Documentation Needs

1. **User Guide**
   - Document the newly implemented commands (/local, /remote, etc.)
   - Provide examples of useful queries for each database
   - Add troubleshooting section for common issues

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Document the model fallback mechanism
   - Explain the database discovery architecture
   - Provide examples for extending the agent with new capabilities

## Testing Strategy

1. Create test scripts for each major component:
   - ✅ Ollama connectivity tests with extended timeouts
   - ✅ Basic model inference tests with CLI and Python
   - SQL query generation tests with working models
   - Database discovery tests
   - UI component tests
   - Performance benchmarks for different hardware configurations

2. Develop integration tests for the complete workflow

## DevOps Considerations

1. Add health check endpoint for monitoring
2. Consider containerization for easier deployment
3. Implement automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

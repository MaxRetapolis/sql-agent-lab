# SQL Agent Test Results

## System Status

1. **Ollama Service**
   - ✅ Ollama installed successfully in `/home/coder/bin/ollama`
   - ✅ Ollama service is running (high CPU usage: ~85%)
   - ✅ Multiple models installed:
     - `qwen2.5-coder:0.5b` (531 MB) - ❌ Tensor initialization error
     - `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` (986 MB) - ❌ Tensor initialization error 
     - `llama3.2:1b` (1.3 GB) - ❌ Tensor initialization error
     - `deepseek-r1:1.5b` (1.1 GB) - ✅ Functional but slow (takes about 2-3 minutes)
     - `phi:latest` (1.6 GB) - ✅ Functional but slow (takes about 2-3 minutes, preferred option)
     - `gemma2:latest` (5.4 GB) - ❌ Unknown model architecture error
   - Extended timeout testing confirmed:
     - phi:latest responds correctly with simple SQL generation
     - Models work but require very long timeouts (2-3 minutes)

2. **Database Files**
   - ✅ `app/data/shop.db` - Contains product, customer, order data
   - ✅ `app/data/inventory.db` - Contains inventory and order data
   - ✅ `app/data/usage.db` - Contains usage statistics

3. **SQL Query Execution**
   - ✅ Direct SQL queries execute successfully
   - ✅ Complex joins and queries work correctly
   - ✅ Database schema can be inspected properly

## Application Status

1. **Main Application**
   - ❌ Not fully functional due to dependency issues
   - ❌ Requires Python packages (agno, gradio, dotenv) that aren't installed

2. **Text2SQL Agent**
   - ❌ Not functional due to package dependencies
   - ✅ Code structure supports both local and remote Ollama

## Next Steps

1. **Application Dependencies**
   - Install required Python packages:
     ```
     python3 -m pip install --user python-dotenv gradio sqlalchemy agno
     ```

2. **Ollama Model Issues**
   - All tested models have significant issues:
     - Most models have tensor initialization errors (`tensor 'output.weight' not found`)
     - Some models take 2-3 minutes to generate even simple SQL queries (hardware limitation)
     - The gemma2 model has architecture compatibility issues
   - Improvements made:
     - ✅ Doubled all timeout values throughout the codebase
     - ✅ Some models (phi, deepseek) now work with extended timeouts
     - ✅ Tested direct CLI usage which confirmed the slowness is hardware-related
   - Options:
     - Switch to remote Ollama mode with a more powerful server
     - Try different model architectures (non-Qwen, non-Llama)
     - Add more robust error handling and automatic failover
     - Update Ollama to the latest version

3. **Database Schema**
   - The databases are valid and contain usable data
   - The shop.db database has Products, Customers, Orders, and OrderDetails tables
   - The schema matches what the Text2SQL agent is designed to work with

4. **Application Architecture**
   - The dual-mode architecture (local/remote Ollama) is functional
   - Database discovery works correctly
   - Session persistence (via status_reporter) is implemented but not tested
